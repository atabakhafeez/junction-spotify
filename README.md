This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

Using [Dog API](https://dog.ceo)

Basically just playing around with [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)

# Running it

Classic drill

1. `npm install` or `yarn install`
2. `react-native link` (just to be sure)
3. Run it on the phone, refer to [docs](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#the-react-native-cli)
4. `react-native start`
